## 🎖️ The Journey & Achievement
Our team designed and implemented a **Smart Access Control System** that earned the **Best Group Project Award**. The program covered:
- **Hardware & Data Acquisition:** Real-time monitoring using LabVIEW and NI USB-6001.
- **Computer Vision:** Advanced image processing and edge detection with OpenCV.
- **Embedded AI:** Implementing facial recognition on Raspberry Pi 5.

*Special thanks to **Prof. Ahmed Onsy** the Head of School of Architecture, Computing and Engineering (ACE) of Wolverhampton University, and the faculty at the School of ACE for their invaluable mentorship.*

## 🚀 System Features
- **Dual-Factor Security:** Face Recognition + 4-digit PIN fallback.
- **Hardware Triggered:** System activation via physical button press (GPIO 22).
- **Security Logic:** - 3 failed attempts lead to a 15-second lockout.
    - Silent mode toggle for discreet operations.
- **Edge AI:** Real-time processing using the **IMX500 AI Camera**.
